# swiggy-clone-hackthon
This project is a Swiggy-inspired food delivery web application created for a hackathon. It replicates the essential features of Swiggy while introducing unique enhancements developed by me to improve **health awareness**, **usability**, and **user accessibility**.

## ✨ Features I Implemented

### 🥗 1. Vegan & Diet Meal Options

- **Vegan Food Option**  
  Clicking on the **“Vegan Food”** tile in the Popular Food Categories section takes users to a dedicated page (`vegan.html`) showcasing **vegan-friendly meals**.

- **Diet Food Option**  
  The **“Diet Food”** option leads to the `diet.html` page which displays **low-calorie, health-conscious meal options**, complete with **calorie counts** to help users make informed dietary choices.

### 🧾 2. Bill Splitting Feature

- Users can click on the **“Split The Bill”** button which redirects to `split_bill.html`.
- On that page, users can simulate splitting their order amount among multiple people.
- This feature is ideal for groups of friends or roommates ordering together.

### ♿ 3. Accessibility Tools

To promote inclusivity, I added a **floating accessibility toolbar** on the bottom-right of the page with the following tools:

- **High Contrast Mode (👁️)**  
  Enhances visibility for visually impaired users by toggling dark background and light text.

- **Dyslexia-Friendly Font (📖)**  
  Applies a font that improves readability for users with dyslexia.

These features are fully functional and can be toggled instantly by clicking the respective buttons.
